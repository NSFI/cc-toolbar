# tryit-jssip

The [JsSIP](http://jssip.net) demo application.

Check it online at https://tryit.jssip.net


## Installation

* Fork the project.

* Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

* Globally install the NPM `gulp-cli` package:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

* Build the app (check the [gulpfile](./gulpfile.js) file for details):
  * `gulp prod` generates the app in production/minified mode.
  * `gulp dev` generates the app in development mode.
  * `gulp live` generates the app in development mode, opens the local website and watches for changes in the source code.

* Once built, the `out/` directory is created with all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to be deployed in your own server.


## Hardcoded settings

The app allows entering settings via an HTTP form in the Login section. However, the developer can hardcode some specific settings (for example the _callstats.io_  settings) by defining a `window.SETTINGS` variable before the `tryit-jssip.js` is loaded.

Check the commented code in the [index.html](./index.html) and fill it as needed.


## Notes

* If you run this web application into your own domain, you will also need to set your own SIP/WebSocket servers. The SIP servers running at the public demo won't accept connections origins other than `https://tryit.jssip.net`.
